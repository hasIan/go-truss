# Truss
# truss-build Docker image
#
# NOTE: YOU WILL PROBABLY NEVER NEED TO CREATE A TRUSS-BUILD IMAGE. The primary use
# of the truss-build image will be to create updated truss-run images A pre-built
# truss-build image from the Docker registry can build the binaries that are
# required for a Truss runtime image. Or more simply, a pre-built truss-run image
# can be used, if it meets your needs.
#
# This Dockerfile builds an image that can itself build Truss. The container
# that runs this image must mount the project source code to an external
# volume, so the go compiler can build it should have a volume mounted, so it
# can read the Truss code and generate binaries.
#
# The base of this Docker image is a full Linux distribution, because the protoc
# binary is dynamically linked and requires libraries that are not present in a
# minimal distribution like Alpine. We pull the required libraries from this base
# image and package them up to be added to the runtime image.
#
# E.g., docker run --rm -v $PWD:/go/src/github.com/TuneLab/go-truss tunelab/truss-build
#
# The binaries are subsequently packaged into a Docker image for running Truss.
# The runtime images is much smaller because of this.
